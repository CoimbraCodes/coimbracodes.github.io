We are proud to announce the release of our website - [coimbra.codes](http://coimbra.codes). The website will be mostly used for sharing new content about Coimbra.codes and the .codes movement.

Soon, we will publish a cookbook (together with a pack) with information about the .codes movement. This will include not only our Manifesto, but also a guide on how to organize a .codes event.
