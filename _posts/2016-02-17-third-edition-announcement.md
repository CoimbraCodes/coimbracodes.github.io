The third edition of Coimbra.codes is on its way, this time we are back home at [Nest Collective](http://nestcollective.co/), home of [Redlight Software](http://weareredlight.com/), [Bloco.io](http://bloco.io/), [Deemaze](http://deemaze.com/) and other cool guys.

For those who don't know, Coimbra.codes is an informal event where developers and designers gather to talk code and have fun. This time there will be three talks:

* "Rails + React + Redux" by Tony Gon√ßalves (RedLight Software)
* "Functional Programming With or Without Haskell" by Alcides Fonseca (University of Coimbra)
* One more to be announced
